# PlanetApp

Repository for a planet information site, building my understanding of full-stack development.

## Improvements required

- Adequate git branching policy and permissions, enforce passing build with tests, PRs and approvals before merge
- Shared contract packaged for 'Planet' JSON object which covers app, web and data layers.
- RESTful API which allows planetary data to be pulled based on path query
